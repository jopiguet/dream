# Non-fiction book projects

## Summary

This project is about describing very complicated and intracated topics for everyone (from 3 to 121).
Everyone is able to understand anything when someone takes the time to clarify the concepts. I aim to be able to transmit knowledge.
The project is about science, my main life endeavour, philosophy, society, everyday life, and politics. I will describe how people, group of people or civilizations have tried to describe and explain their world. The final step will always be to reach our current paradigm.


## Structure

The book is structured in chapters. There is no hierarchical or chronological order. It follows the order my kids, my family, my friends, or anyone in my life who ask the questions. The last chapter will be about each question and who asked it.
